CRITICAL: Your task is to analyze ONLY the content within the specified time range, from {{startTime}} seconds to {{endTime}} seconds. Ignore all content outside this range. Based on this clip, identify key moments and opportunities for impactful edits to make it more engaging for marketing. Provide a list of suggestions in JSON format. The `frameIndex` in your suggestions MUST be the time in seconds *relative to the start of the clip*. For example, a suggestion for a moment occurring at {{startTime}} + 3 seconds into the video should have a `frameIndex` of 3.",
